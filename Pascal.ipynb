    "# Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "Pascal's Triangle is renowned for its use in mathematics, particularly in the expansion of binomials. To study its quirks, as well as to connect the realms of computer science and mathematics, I created two representations of this shape in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, with a little more investigation, I implemented Pascal's Pyramid: a three dimensional representation of the coefficients in a trinomial expansion. In other words, the 3D version of Pascal's Triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I present my findings and how I devised algorithms to represent Pascal's shapes.\n",

    "First, we must familiarize ourselves with some basic knowledge of Pascal's Triangle. Starting from 0, the triangle has n rows and k columns, where $n, k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{0\\}$. To illustrate, in Figure 1, the triangle's 7th **row** is the sequence \"1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1.\" Furthermore, the triangle's 2nd **column** is the sequence \"1 3 6 10 15 21.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What's unique about Pascal's Triangle is its recursive nature. That is, every entry in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. So, for instance, the number 20 is the summation of 10 + 10. We can, thereby, create a formula to compute the Nth entry in Pascal's Triangle. This is known as Pascal's Rule (see Figure 2).\n",

    "## List Representation <a name=\"list-representation\"></a>\n",
    "Representing Pascal's Triangle as a list is quite easy. If we imagine each row as a list, then we can represent Pascal's Triangle as a single list of nested lists."
